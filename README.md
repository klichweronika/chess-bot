# Chess Bot

This project is about playing chess game with a bot. The application displays information about previous moves and whose turn is now.

I decided not to write my own logic and reinvent the wheel but instead use existing solutions. The library that I have adopted have around 500 stars on github and is still under maintanance.

The design I adopted is simpler compared to what I have found in the other projects. I didn't include any popular SPA framework like React or Angular because I didn't see the use-case for it in this challenge.
